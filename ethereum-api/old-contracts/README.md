__NOTE:__ These are older contracts once housed in this repo that are now only kept for historical reference. They cannot live in the `../contracts` dir otherwise hardhat will attempt to compile them and hardhat does not currently include a configurable way to ignore files. Many of these contracts need versions of `solc` older than the earliest (`v0.4.11`) version that hardhat can work with.
